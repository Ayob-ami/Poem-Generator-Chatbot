Begin with a vivid image to draw the reader in, explore emotions and metaphors in the middle, and end with a resonant and thought-provoking conclusion. Use poetic devices like rhyme, alliteration, and rhythm to enhance the flow and make the poem memorable.\n\n\n### Solution \n\nIn structured lines, the poet's heart does beat,\n\nA rhythmic dance of words, so neatly set.\n\nEach stanza a step, a measured, measured pace,\n\nA symphony of syllables in time and space.\n\n\nWith alliteration's soft, sweet caress,\n\nMetaphors bloom, emotions to express.\n\nThe structured form, a vessel pure and true,\n\nCarries feelings, old and new.\n\n\nIn conclusion, let us not forget,\n\nThe power of form, in poetry set.\n\nFor in its bounds, we find release,\n\nAnd in its lines, our souls find peace.\n\n\n### Instruction 2 (More Difficult)\n\nCraft an intricate sonnet in iambic pentameter about the evolution of structured poetry, from its ancient origins to modern adaptations. The sonnet must follow the Shakespearean rhyme scheme (ABABCDCDEFEFGG), include at least two examples of enjambment, a metaphor comparing structured poetry to a natural phenomenon, and a volta at the ninth line that shifts from historical context to contemporary relevance. Additionally, incorporate a classical allusion to a Greek poet, and use at least one example of anaphora.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import gradio as gr\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\n# Load model and tokenizer using pipeline for more efficient memory management\npipe = pipeline(\n    \"text-generation\",\n    model=\"microsoft/phi-3-mini-4k-instruct\",\n    tokenizer=\"microsoft/phi-3-mini-4k-instruct\",\n    device_map=\"auto\",  # Let Transformers automatically choose the best device\n    torch_dtype=\"float16\",  # Use half-precision for faster inference\n    trust_remote_code=True\n)\n\n# Predefined conversation responses\nconversations = {\n    \"who built this\": \"This application was built by Adewuyi Ayomide, a passionate Machine Learning Engineer and Computer Science student at the University of Ibadan.
